# Frontend Service Endpoint Fixes

This document outlines all the fixes made to ensure frontend services correctly use the API endpoints.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Inventory Service (`inventoryService.ts`)
**Problems:**
- ❌ `createInventoryItem` was calling `/inventory/add` but API expects `/inventory/` (POST)
- ❌ `searchInventory` was calling `/inventory/product/${query}` but API has `/inventory/search/${query}`

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Updated `createInventoryItem` to use `/inventory/` endpoint
- ✅ Updated `searchInventory` to use `/inventory/search/${query}` endpoint

### 2. Sale Service (`saleService.ts`)
**Problems:**
- ❌ `createSale` was calling `/sale/create` but API uses `/sales/` (POST)

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Updated `createSale` to use `/sales/` endpoint

### 3. Customer Service (`customerService.ts`)
**Problems:**
- ❌ `getCustomerOrders` was calling `/customer/orders` which doesn't exist
- ❌ Missing basic CRUD operations for customers

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Added full CRUD operations: `getCustomers`, `getCustomerById`, `createCustomer`, `updateCustomer`, `deleteCustomer`
- ✅ Updated `getCustomerOrders` to use `/sales/` endpoint and transform data
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces for `Customer` and `SaleData`

### 4. Delivery Service (`deliveryService.ts`)
**Problems:**
- ❌ Using fake/mock delivery service instead of real API calls
- ❌ No connection to actual `/deliverers/` endpoints

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Replaced fake service with real API calls to `/deliverers/` endpoints
- ✅ Added full CRUD operations: `getDeliverers`, `getDelivererById`, `createDeliverer`, `updateDeliverer`, `deleteDeliverer`
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with legacy function names
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces

### 5. Authentication Configuration (`axiosConfig.ts`)
**Problems:**
- ❌ Authentication interceptor was commented out
- ❌ No automatic token/user handling in requests

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Enabled authentication interceptor
- ✅ Added user ID header (`X-User-ID`) for session-based authentication
- ✅ Added response interceptor for handling 401 errors
- ✅ Integrated with Redux store and localStorage for user data

## New Services Created

### 6. Supplier Service (`supplierService.ts`)
- ✅ Created complete service for `/suppliers/` endpoints
- ✅ Full CRUD operations with proper error handling
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 7. Teller Service (`tellerService.ts`)
- ✅ Created complete service for `/tellers/` endpoints
- ✅ Full CRUD operations with proper error handling
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 8. Receipt Service (`receiptService.ts`)
- ✅ Created complete service for `/reciepts/` endpoints (note: API uses "reciepts" spelling)
- ✅ Full CRUD operations with proper error handling
- ✅ Additional methods for filtering by sale ID and customer ID
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for receipts and receipt items

## API Endpoint Mapping

| Frontend Service | API Endpoint | HTTP Method | Status |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Auth Service** |
| `login` | `/auth/login` | POST | ✅ Correct |
| `register` | `/auth/signup` | POST | ✅ Correct |
| **Inventory Service** |
| `getInventory` | `/inventory/all` | GET | ✅ Correct |
| `getInventoryItemById` | `/inventory/prod/${id}` | GET | ✅ Correct |
| `createInventoryItem` | `/inventory/` | POST | ✅ Fixed |
| `updateInventoryItem` | `/inventory/${id}` | PUT | ✅ Correct |
| `deleteInventoryItem` | `/inventory/${id}` | DELETE | ✅ Correct |
| `searchInventory` | `/inventory/search/${query}` | GET | ✅ Fixed |
| **Sale Service** |
| `createSale` | `/sales/` | POST | ✅ Fixed |
| **Customer Service** |
| `getCustomers` | `/customers/` | GET | ✅ Added |
| `getCustomerById` | `/customers/${id}` | GET | ✅ Added |
| `createCustomer` | `/customers/` | POST | ✅ Added |
| `updateCustomer` | `/customers/${id}` | PUT | ✅ Added |
| `deleteCustomer` | `/customers/${id}` | DELETE | ✅ Added |
| `getCustomerOrders` | `/sales/` | GET | ✅ Fixed (transforms data) |
| **Cart/Mart Service** |
| `getCart` | `/mart/${customerId}` | GET | ✅ Correct |
| `addItemToCart` | `/mart/` | POST | ✅ Correct |
| `updateCartItemQty` | `/mart/` | PUT | ✅ Correct |
| `removeItemFromCart` | `/mart/${customerId}/${productId}` | DELETE | ✅ Correct |
| **Profile Service** |
| `getProfile` | `/profile/${userId}` | GET | ✅ Correct |
| `updateProfile` | `/profile/${userId}` | PUT | ✅ Correct |

## Error Handling Improvements

- ✅ Added consistent try-catch blocks across all services
- ✅ Added proper error logging with descriptive messages
- ✅ Added TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- ✅ Added response interceptor for handling authentication errors

## Authentication Improvements

- ✅ Enabled automatic user ID header injection
- ✅ Integrated with Redux store for user state
- ✅ Added fallback to localStorage for user data
- ✅ Added 401 error handling for unauthorized requests

## Next Steps

1. **Test all endpoints** - Verify that all services work correctly with the backend
2. **Add loading states** - Implement loading indicators in components
3. **Add proper error handling** - Display user-friendly error messages
4. **Implement JWT tokens** - Consider upgrading to JWT-based authentication
5. **Add request/response validation** - Validate data before sending to API
6. **Add caching** - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Notes

- The API uses "reciepts" (misspelled) instead of "receipts" - this is maintained for consistency
- Authentication is currently session-based using user ID headers rather than JWT tokens
- All services include proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Error handling is consistent across all services
